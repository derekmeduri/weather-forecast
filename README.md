# weather-forecast

Homework week 6

We are tasked with creating a 5 day weather forecast for a client. The application should present the user with a search bar that allows them to enter a city name. Once they search they should be presented with the current local weather and a five day forecast. A list should populate with previously searched cities. If the user clicks on those names from the list it should take them back to that cities current and forecasted weather.
